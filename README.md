"Problems from  the Discrete to  the Continuous" by Ross G. Pinsky describes a number of probability, number theory, graph  theory, and combinatoric problems.  
this repository showcases chapter 3: "A One-Dimensional Probabilistic Packing Problem"  

"Consider n molecules lined up in a row. From among the n-1 nearest neighbor pairs, select one pair at random and “bond” the two molecules together. Now from all the remaining nearest neighbor pairs, select one pair at random and bond the two molecules together. Continue like this until no nearest neighbor pairs remain"
